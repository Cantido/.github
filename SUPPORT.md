# Getting Support

If you're having issues with a project of mine, you have a few options:

1. Submit an issue on either the GitHub or sourcehut issue tracker.
2. Send an email to either my public-inbox mailing list or the project-specific list.
3. Message me on Keybase.

I check all of these inboxes regularly.
